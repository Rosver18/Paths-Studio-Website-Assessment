                <p>
                    This website is formed because we like to express our vision to the world.</br>
when we were in school, we were tasked to make a game using Twine, then we made it within a month.</br>

After the semester ended, we decided to officially publish the games that we made so that we can show the world our vision.</br>

we are excited to make more fun and engaging games in the future, especially making different genres of games.</br>
We are also excited to welcome other people to our company and invite their creativity to our studio.</br>
Back then we have played games that touched our hearts and made special memories from them, <br> we hope to 
make games that touch our players hearts.</br>
